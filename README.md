# RobotAnno Arduino 2560
## intruduction
  Based on the arduino mega 2560 controller, the position coordinates, IO port and steering gear control of the six-axis manipulator can be realized. The upper computer software can not only program the action instructions online, IO port, steering gear control, but also realize the download of the program to realize the offline operation of the downloaded action instructions. The control program of the lower computer is open source, and the user can control the six-axis manipulator of DIY by changing the interface. Open source code, can greatly facilitate users to carry out secondary development and optimization.
